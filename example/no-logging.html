  <title>UserALE - Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<br>
<p>
  This UserALE Example Page lets you explore how UserALE works, deploys with a script tag, and the data it generates.<br>
  By default, you'll see the raw logs UserALE generates. We kept this page simple so that its easy to see how things work.
</p>
<p>
  To see how our API can be used to shape UserALE logs to your needs, uncomment the 'index.js' script tag in index.html.
</p>
<br>
<p>Click the button below to generate targeted click events.</p>
<div class="container">
  <button id="test_button">Click Me!</button>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>Play around with the form elements below to see a variety of UserALE log types:</p>
<p>
  Capture changes to fields (and values, when it's safe).
</p>
<p>
  With index.js injected into the page, you can use the 'Test Field' below to see the behavior of our API dynamically.<br>
  Type in the following UserALE function names to see their behavior.
<ul>
  <li>"log" - ship a fully customized log, built from scratch</li>
  <li>"packageLog" - hijack our own pipeline to modify and ship logs packaged exactly like standard UserALE logs</li>
  <li>"packageCustomLog" - smash a number of custom fields together with UserALE standard metadata</li>
</ul>
